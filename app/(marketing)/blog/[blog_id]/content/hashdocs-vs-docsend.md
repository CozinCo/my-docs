- Need to share a pitch deck with investors but with restricted access to certain domains?

- Want to set an expiry date for content shared with your clients / vendors?

- Or simply track pieces of content your viewers are engaging the most with?* 

Unlike an email attachment that is in the wild once it leaves your outbox, **secure link sharing is a great way to maintain full control** over your sensitive documents. 

And for most part, Docsend has been a great starting point.

From single document upload & sharing to creating custom spaces and virtual data rooms, it serves the document sharing needs of startups and enterprises alike.
