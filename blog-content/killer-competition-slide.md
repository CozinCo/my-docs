While every startup would love to say “we have no competition”, unless you are the first product in a completely new market, it is rarely the case. So how do you create a compelling case for your startup while showcasing all your competitors? 

Here’s how. 

### **Firstly, how long should this be?**
The ideal competitive landscape section SHOULD NOT be more than one slide. It might seem like a lot of information to fit in one slide, but know that your investor’s attention span is very limited. 

### **So what should you include in this slide?**

#### **1. List of competitors**

A competitor is anyone who solves the SAME problem for YOUR customer. You might not consider them direct competition, but they still take market share away from your product.  You’ll see below how airbnb lists cragslist, a classifieds platform as it’s competition

You don’t need to include every single competitor in the page - just the major ones. Think “who are some direct or indirect competitors that investors are likely to know?” and just add them

1. What are you better at
    
    Is your product simpler to use? Do you offer features that your competitors don’t? Or are you simply the most cost effective? You need to clearly bring out WHY a customer would choose you over all the other alternatives. 
    
    Here’s a slide that showcases all the features that Google offers, that its competitors do not.

That’s it. You can add more data to the slide, but these are the two components that EVERY competiton slide should contain. 

#### **How should you structure the competition slide?**

As with all data, there are couple of different ways to do it. Pick the one that makes the strongest case for your startup

2. The “classic 2X2”
Take two key parameters that you differentiate on and plot on on a 2X2 map. Make sure that these are two parameters that matter to your customers. Bringing back the oft-quoted airbnb example. The two parameters they picked were - is it online? and is it affordable?

3. The “Union of features”
If you have one set of competitors that do well on one parameter, and another set that does well on a second parameter, and you combine both, this is a great way to showcase that. You can do this for more parameters too. See below the example of Slack - and how it combines various features that standalone apps offer in one simple interface.

4. The “Feature dump”

If it’s hard to showcase what you differentiate on using the 2X2 or the union, a simple list of features with a tick or cross is the way to go. You can also do this with emojis! Here’s how Fibery  - a no code company workspace manager does it.

The format you pick does not matter. You simple goal should be “Can I prove I am better than my competitors in under 30 seconds”
